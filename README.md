### Setting up the project

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DeusloVult/shop.co-ecommerce.git
    ```
2. Copy the contents from `env.example` into a new file named `.env.local`.

3. If you are using a local database, start the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
   Alternatively, if you're connecting to an external database, specify the database connection string in your `.env.local` file:
    ```plaintext
    DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
    ```

4. Install the project dependencies using `pnpm`:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

5. Apply database migrations to set up the database schema:
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

6. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

## üöÄ Folder Structure

- Use English for naming folders and files.
- For creating files, use the format `feature-name.ts` or `feature-name.tsx` (e.g., `data-products.ts`).
- Create folders to group related files within a category (e.g., `components`, `utils`).
- Manage imports using the Autobarrel extension for better organization and easier access from the main folder.

## üìù Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Fetch the latest updates from the main branch:
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
3. Switch to the development branch:
    ```bash
    git switch dev
    ```
4. Create a new branch for your changes, using a descriptive name:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5. Always pull the latest changes from the `dev` branch before starting to work on a new feature:
    ```bash
    git pull origin dev
    ```
6. Contribute by opening a Pull Request (PR).
7. If you encounter any bugs or would like to suggest new features, create an issue and assign the appropriate labels.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Dummy Data

- The `data` folder is responsible for creating mock data for testing.
- Each data file should be generated using `data-generator.ts` to ensure consistency.
- Eventually, this dummy data will be replaced with actual data from the database.
